(we dont really input the days that something will be hired for, it is normally an open hire)

the system is currently trying to record the duration of the hire
the business does not typically do that
the business does open hires


turn of the password expiration


missing new hire
get_quote_details is not properly set up
check create_off_hire process
create_application is not properly set up

please check create_off_hire process that it also works properly.
(also the create_hire procedure)

remember there are helpers procedures.
I want to create simple procedures that offload to the helpers if possible.



could you please go through database/procedures/interactions/create_hire.sql and validate its process.

later, when the program is done. I want a front end with a drop down, the user selects "new hire"
the ui then pupulates divs/blocks with customer info, date info, equipment info, site info, ...

there will be a python business logic layer that will take the input data and feed it into the create_hire procedure and create a new interaction and driver task.
