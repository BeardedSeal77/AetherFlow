## ALLOCATION WORKFLOW (Future Enhancement)

### Phase 2: Equipment Allocation

Allocation Interface:

- Allows selection of specific units: R1001, R1002
- Updates booking status to "allocated"
- Creates specific equipment records
- Enables quality control workflow

Business Logic:
```sql
-- Convert generic booking to specific allocation
UPDATE interaction_equipment_types 
SET booking_status = 'allocated' 
WHERE id = 1;

INSERT INTO interaction_equipment (
    interaction_id, equipment_id, equipment_type_booking_id
) VALUES 
(1, 1, 1), -- R1001 allocated to booking 1
(1, 2, 1); -- R1002 allocated to booking 1
```
